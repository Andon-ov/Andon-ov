Hi there! üëã

I'm Andon Andonov, a Python Web Developer with a specialization from SoftUni. Currently, 
I'm in the final stages of my education and working on my last project called Local-News-Hub. üéì

I have a passion for learning, and my current focus is on expanding my knowledge in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
I'm also excited about diving into React in the near future! üå±

In addition to web development, I'm also actively studying DevOps to broaden my skill set. 
I'm eager to explore the world of infrastructure management, automation, and cloud technologies. üöÄ

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me. 
You can easily contact me via email at Andon.ov@yahoo.com. I'll be more than happy to help you out! üí¨

In addition to programming, I have a deep love for Python, JavaScript, and Linux. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead!
